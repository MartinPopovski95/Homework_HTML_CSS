            Some games are so iconic that bringing them to new platforms is a must when the chance arises. <em>Red Dead
                Redemption</em> has finally arrived on <b><i>PC/Steam</i></b>, so if you've never experienced the
            journey of <a href="https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/John_Marston" target="_blank">John Marston</a>, now's
            your chance to do it on your computer!<br />

            In the story, Marston is trying to lead a peaceful life with his family, but he's forced back into action to
            hunt down members of his former gang, the Van Der Linde Gang. Ride across the frontier, facing off against

        <p>
            Including a <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/" target="_blank">VR</a> title on this list says a lot in itself. VR is
            often hailed as "the future of gaming," yet only a small number of players actually engage with it.<br />

            But with games like <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, you’ll start to see the draw of high-quality VR
            experiences. Set within the universe of the four <a
                href="https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Series"><i>“Arkham games”</i></a> , you’ll step
            back into Batman’s boots, uncovering the mystery surrounding the elusive Ratcatcher!<br />

            Through Batman’s own perspective, you’ll face off against foes and encounter key figures from the original
            games. Here’s hoping you have a Meta 3 headset to fully immerse yourself in the action!

            This list has its fair share of remakes, and <em>Until Dawn</em> is among them. The game gets a full visual
            upgrade, enhancing details and character expressions as you navigate the horror. You’re part of a group of
            friends revisiting a winter resort a year after terrifying events, only to find the nightmare returning.
            Discover the truth and make choices that determine everyone’s fate.

            <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> might have mixed reactions, but there’s no denying it was one of
            October’s biggest releases, with a dedicated fanbase behind it.<br />

            In this long-awaited Bioware title, your mission is to gather a team to confront a world-ending threat
            capable of corrupting everything in its path. Stand together, rise up, and do whatever it takes to seal away

        <p>
            It’s fitting to include <em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em> on this list, as it blends both old and new.
            This game remasters the classic Generations storyline, uniting past and present Sonic to face a familiar
            threat, while adding fresh content that delves into Shadow The Hedgehog’s origins.<br />

            Most fans are excited for Shadow’s new storyline—especially with his upcoming appearance in the live-action
            movie, making this a great chance to get to know him before seeing him on the big screen.

            alt="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 photo" width="700" />

        <p>
            We’re a bit hesitant to discuss <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> since it doesn’t offer much that’s new
            compared to previous titles. While it’s an improvement over last year’s game, that’s not saying much.<br />

            The main campaign is set during the Gulf War, where you must uncover the truth to clear your team’s name.
            However, most players will likely grab it for the multiplayer modes and zombie battles, and we can’t blame
            you for that. If you’re interested, go for it!

        <p>
            We’re prioritizing <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> over the FPS title—deal with it! This game excited
            franchise fans from the start, featuring over 180 characters, including those from non-canon movies. With
            engaging “What If?” scenarios, a robust tournament mode, and customizable matches, it’s the most
            comprehensive game in the series. Plus, it sold 3 million copies on launch day—pretty impressive!

        <p>
            In consideration of its potential as the 2024 “Game of the Year,” we’re highlighting <em>Metaphor:
                ReFantazio</em> in this final slot. This game offers a personal twist on Atlus's fantasy and RPG styles.
            You aim to become the king by winning the people's support, building a personal crew, enhancing your
            “Archetypes” in battle, and proving to be a ruler the realm can admire.
